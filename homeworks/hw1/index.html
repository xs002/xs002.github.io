        <h2>Part Two</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I Learned that we should always remain curious about our surroundings, in this specific instance, when we look at instagrams, spotify, etc. we should always be wondering about why they are designed this why. Having an observant and curious mind is the main point here!</li>
            <li>My favorite part about this article is how it started talking about her personal experince designing webiste and I can certainly relate to that. Also,she mentioned that we should always have a curious mind, contantly thinking about how things are done, why they are designed this way,etc. I also liked how this website is very clean and readble, I think I will definitely learn from that. </li>
            <li> "By routinely analyzing other apps, you will develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
            <li>8 I liked it!</li>
